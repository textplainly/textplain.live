# Beyond Markdown demo

*A demonstration of John MacFarlane's ideas in [Beyond Markdown]
implemented using PTSS.*

To get an idea of how simple and straightforward Plain Text Stylesheets are, check out
[the diff] between `commonmark.ptss` and `beyond-markdown.ptss`.

The sections below parallel the six sections of the [Beyond Markdown] essay. I've even adopted the CSS from John's essay.

## 1. Emphasis


## 2. Reference links


## 3. Code


## 4. Lists


## 5. HTML


## 6. Attributes
