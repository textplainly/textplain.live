         as you see by switching to `GFM.ptss`. You can of course
         see it in the source. [RepoDoc] gives you the option to
         make it visible, rendered nicely as an aside or
         interjection as you can see by using switching to
         `RubyRhod.ptss`, **with full markup rendering**.)
