#### Style Explorations


The idea herein is to explore a variety plain text styles (e.g. many of those in archeology and catalog of styles.

Each of the styles below will name which stylesheet(s) will render this style correctly (can name more than one to show versatility).

Auto-scroll syncing upon each change of stylesheet will be essential for this to be usable. i.e. if on the source side I scroll down to a particular style idea #17, which tells me to select `Plain Jane` from the style sheet dropdown, and I do, then the render pane should immediately autoscroll to the newly rendered form of style idea #17.

If there are very many style ideas, can break this into multiple files.

Whether grouped by sections of by separate files, ideas should be grouped by area of exploration (e.g. interjections) if the exploration is a progressive one such as in archeology, or by stylesheet if the idea is a stylesheet-level one, OR possibly because it will be annoying to switch stylesheets so often.
