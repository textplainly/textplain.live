hey there.

   this is a poem
   you know, the
   kind where i
   am supposed to rhyme
   or have rhythm
   but not
   necessarily reason

hey there.

    this is a block quote.
    you know, where i quote you.
    where the text
    wraps like
    regular text, even
    if the source
    looks poetic.

All because of a difference of a space.
