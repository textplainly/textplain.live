#### Comparative Explorations

(This is another way to do *Problem Explorations*, to use selectively or universally, TBD)


##### topic x stylesheet samples

- Make samples of the *same* content using different styles.
- Name them like follows:
  - text-blocks-and-line-breaks-in-Markdown.md
  - text-blocks-and-line-breaks-in-PlainJane.pj

   
##### same-content x stylesheet samples

If the above will result in too many samples, we can instead have one or two sample files with identical content but in different styles. The content would cover a variety of topics, reducing the number of sample files.

Perhaps:

- explorations-in-Markdown.md
- explorations-in-PlainJane.md
