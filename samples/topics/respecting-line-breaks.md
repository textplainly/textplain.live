# Respecting line breaks

explore a style that respects all line breaks

- left margin containers
- verse

- containers with right borders
- table rows that cannot fit within a reasonable line width
  (table cells are much like containers with right borders)
- warning boxes with a left border (because we cannot expect even smart non-PTSS-aware editors to add the left border to wrapped lines
